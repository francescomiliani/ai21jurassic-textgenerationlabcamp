Creating and setting up a Python virtual environment (venv) is a good practice to isolate project dependencies and avoid conflicts between different projects. Here's a step-by-step guide to creating and activating a Python virtual environment:

### Using Command Line:

1. **Open a terminal or command prompt:**
   - On Windows, you can use Command Prompt or PowerShell.
   - On macOS or Linux, you can use the terminal.

2. **Navigate to your project directory:**
   ```bash
   cd path/to/your/project
   ```

3. **Create a virtual environment:**
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   ```
   This command uses the `venv` module to create a virtual environment named "venv" in your project directory. Replace `python` with `python3` on some systems.

4. **Activate the virtual environment:**
   - On Windows:
     ```bash
     .\venv\Scripts\activate
     ```
   - On macOS and Linux:
     ```bash
     source venv/bin/activate
     ```

   Once activated, your terminal prompt will change to indicate that you are now working within the virtual environment.

5. **Install packages as needed:**
   Now you can use `pip` to install Python packages, and they will be isolated within your virtual environment.
   ```bash
   pip install package_name
   ```

6. **Deactivate the virtual environment:**
   When you're done working in the virtual environment, you can deactivate it.
   ```bash
   deactivate
   ```

### Using Visual Studio Code:

If you're using Visual Studio Code, you can create and manage virtual environments directly from the integrated terminal. Here's a brief guide:

1. **Open your project in Visual Studio Code.**

2. **Open the integrated terminal:**
   - Use the keyboard shortcut `Ctrl + `` (backtick) on Windows/Linux or `Cmd + `` on macOS.
   - Alternatively, you can go to `View -> Terminal` from the menu.

3. **Run the following commands in the terminal:**
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   ```

4. **Activate the virtual environment:**
   ```bash
   .\venv\Scripts\activate      # On Windows
   source venv/bin/activate     # On macOS/Linux
   ```

5. **Install packages as needed:**
   ```bash
   pip install package_name
   ```

6. **Deactivate the virtual environment:**
   ```bash
   deactivate
   ```

Remember to activate the virtual environment every time you work on your project and deactivate it when you're finished. This helps keep your project dependencies isolated and avoids conflicts with other projects.

### Token amount consideration
Each message passed to the API consumes the number of tokens in the content, role, and other fields, plus a few extra for behind-the-scenes formatting. This may change slightly in the future.

If a conversation has too many tokens to fit within a modelâ€™s maximum limit (e.g., more than 4097 tokens for gpt-3.5-turbo), you will have to truncate, omit, or otherwise shrink your text until it fits. Beware that if a message is removed from the messages input, the model will lose all knowledge of it.

Note that very long conversations are more likely to receive incomplete replies. For example, a gpt-3.5-turbo conversation that is 4090 tokens long will have its reply cut off after just 6 tokens.
